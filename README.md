# Chat and Chill
This is an online or offline(localhost) chat application. To create the connection I used a client-server model, using TCP / IP.

Someone will need to host a server through DedicatedServer.exe.
After that, anyone that have the ip and the port, can connect to that server.

Closing the main application will disconnect you from server, and all messages will be lost.

I rewriten the entire app code, using a new package for TCP called EasyTCP.

EasyTCP - on nuget:https://www.nuget.org/packages/EasyTcp/
